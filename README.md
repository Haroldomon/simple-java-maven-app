# A Simple Maven Java Application
This repository is a simple Maven Java application that can be used as a starting point for a new project. It contains a single Java class and a single JUnit test class. The Java class is a simple "Hello World" program. The JUnit test class tests the Java class to verify that the "Hello World" message is correct.
**Note that this repository configuration files are not my own. It is officially from the Jenkins Docs and I have just used it for my own learning purposes.**
